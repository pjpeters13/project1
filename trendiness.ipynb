Data Interpretation: While the overall trend from 2010 to around 2019 indicates a decrease, the sudden rise in reported cases in 2020 might suggest a change in the pattern of crime, a change in reporting behavior, or external factors influencing crime rates or reporting. The increase in 2022 could warrant further investigation to understand its cause â€” whether it is due to actual increases in crime or changes in data collection, reporting practices, or other factors."
